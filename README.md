# CollaborativeWhiteBoard
I made it in html , JS c'se why complicate life when you can make a lemonade in your free time



# Steps to run:
- Open the HTML file in both of the browser
- One of the client ( Let's say A ) must click on " create offer " and share the created offer to the other client ( Let's say Client B )
- Client B must paste the created offer in the " paste offer " and click on the " create answer " and share the created answer to Client A
- Client A must paste it in the " Paste Answer Section " and click on " set answer "
- Wait for a couple of seconds for the connection to establish.
- Enjoy your collaborative white board

# Pros
- Lightweight
- Peer to Peer connection, neither is the whiteboard is being stored in some server, nor is it being fetched from a server to show the changes.
